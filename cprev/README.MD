# Checkpoint% reversed

Trigger each checkpoint in a reversed order, and then finish the level.

You may find it usefull to trigger the passzone and then do the cp% reversed, so you can finish by falling into the void, without needing to go back to the finish

Edge case: Dark cp6 is skipped (for now), untill me or plcc or you finds a way to hit it without hitting cp5 first
